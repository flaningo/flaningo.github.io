# Welcome to my website!

I specialize in cell culture, flow cytometry, and cytokine analysis using ELISA and RT-qPCR.
My expertise extends to viability assays with AlamarBlueâ„¢ (Invitrogen).
I have hands-on experience working with mice tissue (lungs, uterus, gut) and human blood.
Additionally, I conduct metabolic analysis of immune cells using BODIPY, 2-NBDG, and MitoTracker.
My skill set also includes proficiency with cytospin, fluorescence microscopy, and seahorse assays.
